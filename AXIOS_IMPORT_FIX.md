# Axios Import Fix

## Problem
Console error: `ReferenceError: axios is not defined` in QRManagementPage.jsx

## Root Cause
The `axios` import was missing from the QRManagementPage component, even though it was being used in the `fetchRestaurantInfo` function.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Import Statement
```javascript
// Before (missing axios import)
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { ArrowLeft } from "lucide-react";
import { useAuth } from "../../context/MultiAuthContext";
import QRCodeManager from "../../components/QRCodeManager";

// After (added axios import)
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { ArrowLeft } from "lucide-react";
import axios from "axios";
import { useAuth } from "../../context/MultiAuthContext";
import QRCodeManager from "../../components/QRCodeManager";
```

### Cleaned Up Debug Code
- Removed debug section from QRGenerationPage
- Removed debug useEffect
- Cleaned up console logs

## Files Modified
1. **QRManagementPage.jsx** - Added missing axios import
2. **QRGenerationPage.jsx** - Removed debug code

## Expected Behavior Now

### QR Generation Page
