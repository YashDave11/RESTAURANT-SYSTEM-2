# Customer-Based Feedback System Fix

## ‚úÖ **Problem Solved: Feedback History Now Based on Customer ID, Not Table ID**

### **Issue Identified:**
When logged-in customers sat at any table, they were seeing feedback points from previous customers who sat at the same table, instead of their own personal feedback history.

**Root Cause:**
- `fetchCustomerPoints()` in MenuPage was using table-based session ID
- Points were being fetched based on `restaurantId-tableNumber` instead of customer email
- Logged-in customers were seeing accumulated points from all previous customers at that table

### **üîß Fixes Implemented:**

#### **1. Updated MenuPage fetchCustomerPoints Function:**
```javascript
const fetchCustomerPoints = async () => {
  // Check if customer is logged in first
  const customerSession = getCustomerSession();
  
  let response;
  if (customerSession.isAuthenticated && customerSession.user?.email) {
    // Logged in customer - get their personal points across all restaurants
    response = await axios.get(`/api/feedback/customer/email/${encodeURIComponent(customerSession.user.email)}/orders`);
  } else {
    // Guest customer - get points for this table/restaurant session
    const sessionId = `${restaurantId}-${tableNumber}`;
    response = await axios.get(`/api/feedback/customer/${sessionId}/orders`);
  }
  
  setCustomerPoints(response.data.totalPoints || 0);
};
```

#### **2. Updated useEffect Dependencies:**
- Added `isCustomerAuthenticated` to dependency arrays
- Points refresh when customer authentication state changes
- Ensures points update when customer logs in/out

#### **3. Customer-First Priority Logic:**
- **Logged-in Customers**: Always use email-based identification
- **Guest Customers**: Use table-based identification only when not logged in
- **Cross-Restaurant Points**: Logged-in customers see points from ALL restaurants

### **üéØ How It Works Now:**

#### **For Logged-in Customers:**
1. **Personal Points**: Shows only their own feedback points
2. **Cross-Restaurant**: Points from all restaurants they've visited
3. **Table Independent**: Points don't change based on which table they sit at
4. **Persistent**: Points follow the customer across different sessions

#### **For Guest Customers:**
1. **Table-Based**: Points tied to specific table/restaurant combination
2. **Session Specific**: Only shows points for current table session
3. **Temporary**: Points don't persist across different tables

### **üîç Customer Experience Examples:**

#### **Before Fix (Incorrect):**
- Customer A logs in at Table 1 ‚Üí Sees 50 points (from previous customers)
- Customer B logs in at Table 1 ‚Üí Sees same 50 points
- Customer A moves to Table 2 ‚Üí Sees different points from Table 2

#### **After Fix (Correct):**
- Customer A logs in at Table 1 ‚Üí Sees their personal 20 points
- Customer B logs in at Table 1 ‚Üí Sees their personal 35 points  
- Customer A moves to Table 2 ‚Üí Still sees their personal 20 points

### **üöÄ Technical Implementation:**

#### **Priority Logic:**
1. **Check Authentication**: Is customer logged in?
2. **If Logged In**: Use customer email for identification
3. **If Guest**: Use table-based session ID
4. **Fetch Data**: From appropriate endpoint
5. **Display Points**: Customer-specific or table-specific

#### **API Endpoints Used:**
- **Logged-in**: `/api/feedback/customer/email/{email}/orders`
- **Guest**: `/api/feedback/customer/{sessionId}/orders`

### **‚úÖ Result:**
- **Logged-in customers** now see only their own feedback points
- **Points are persistent** across different tables and sessions
- **Guest customers** still work with table-based points
- **No more point contamination** between different customers
- **Accurate point tracking** for rewards and loyalty programs

### **üéØ Benefits:**
1. **Privacy**: Customers only see their own data
2. **Accuracy**: Points correctly reflect individual customer activity
3. **Loyalty**: Proper tracking for reward programs
4. **Trust**: Customers can trust their point balance
5. **Scalability**: Works across multiple restaurants and tables

The feedback system now properly separates customer data and ensures each logged-in customer sees only their own feedback history and points!
