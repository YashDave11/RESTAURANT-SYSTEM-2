# Customer-Based Order History Fix

## ✅ **Complete Fix: Order History Now Based on Customer Email, Not Table Number**

### **Issue Resolved:**
Order history was showing empty results for logged-in customers when they entered a new table number, because the system was fetching orders based on table sessions instead of customer identity.

### **🔧 Complete Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Updated MenuPage History Button Logic:**
```javascript
// History Button Click Handler
onClick={() => {
  const customerSession = getCustomerSession();
  if (customerSession.isAuthenticated) {
    // Logged in customer - show all their orders across restaurants
    navigate('/customer/orders');
  } else {
    // Guest customer - show orders for this table/restaurant
    navigate(`/customer/history/${restaurantId}`);
  }
}}
```

#### **2. Enhanced CustomerOrderHistory Page:**
- **Added customer authentication detection**
- **Dual-mode order fetching** based on customer type
- **Smart navigation handling** for both customer types

#### **3. Customer-Based Order Fetching:**
```javascript
const fetchOrderHistory = async (table) => {
  const customerSession = getCustomerSession();
  
  let response;
  if (customerSession.isAuthenticated && customerSession.user?.email) {
    // Logged in customer - get ALL their orders across ALL restaurants
    response = await axios.get(`/api/feedback/customer/email/${email}/orders`);
  } else {
    // Guest customer - get orders for this specific table/restaurant session
    const sessionId = `${restaurantId}-${table}`;
    response = await axios.get(`/api/feedback/customer/${sessionId}/orders`);
  }
};
```

#### **4. Improved User Interface:**
- **Dynamic headers**: Shows "All your orders" for logged-in vs "Table X" for guests
- **Restaurant names**: Displayed for logged-in customers (multi-restaurant orders)
- **Table numbers**: Displayed for guest customers (table-specific orders)
- **Appropriate empty states**: Different messages for each customer type

### **🎯 How It Works Now:**

#### **For Logged-in Customers:**
1. **Click History Button** → Navigate to comprehensive order history
2. **See ALL Orders** → From all restaurants and tables they've visited
3. **Restaurant Names** → Shown for each order (multi-restaurant support)
4. **Persistent History** → Same orders regardless of current table
5. **Cross-Restaurant** → Orders from Restaurant A, B, C all visible

#### **For Guest Customers:**
1. **Click History Button** → Navigate to table-specific history
2. **See Table Orders** → Only orders from current table session
3. **Table Numbers** → Shown for each order
4. **Session-Specific** → Different tables = different histories
5. **Restaurant-Specific** → Only current restaurant orders

### **📱 User Experience Examples:**

#### **Logged-in Customer Journey:**
```
Customer A logs in:
- Has orders from Restaurant X (Table 1, 3, 5)
- Has orders from Restaurant Y (Table 2, 7)
- Has orders from Restaurant Z (Table 4)

Sits at any table in any restaurant:
→ History shows ALL orders from X, Y, Z
→ Restaurant names displayed for each order
→ Complete order history regardless of current table
```

#### **Guest Customer Journey:**
```
Guest at Restaurant X, Table 5:
→ History shows only orders from Table 5 at Restaurant X

Same guest moves to Table 3:
→ History shows only orders from Table 3 at Restaurant X
→ Different table = different history
```

### **🔍 Key Improvements:**

#### **1. Smart Navigation:**
- **Logged-in**: `/customer/orders` (comprehensive)
- **Guest**: `/customer/history/{restaurantId}` (table-specific)

#### **2. Dynamic Content:**
- **Headers**: Adapt based on customer type
- **Order Details**: Show relevant information (restaurant vs table)
- **Empty States**: Appropriate messages for each scenario

#### **3. Data Consistency:**
- **Customer-based**: Orders follow the customer
- **Table-based**: Orders tied to table sessions (for guests)
- **No Mixing**: Clear separation between customer types

### **✅ Final Result:**

#### **For Logged-in Customers:**
- ✅ **Complete order history** across all restaurants and tables
- ✅ **No empty history** when entering new table numbers
- ✅ **Restaurant identification** for multi-restaurant orders
- ✅ **Persistent data** that follows the customer

#### **For Guest Customers:**
- ✅ **Table-specific history** as expected
- ✅ **Session-based tracking** for anonymous users
- ✅ **Clear table identification** for each order
- ✅ **Appropriate scope** for guest experience

### **🎯 Benefits:**
1. **Accurate History**: Customers see their complete order history
2. **No Empty States**: Logged-in customers always see their orders
3. **Multi-Restaurant**: Support for customers visiting multiple restaurants
4. **Clear Separation**: Guest vs customer experiences are distinct
5. **Better UX**: Appropriate information for each user type

The order history system now properly reflects customer identity rather than table sessions for authenticated users!
