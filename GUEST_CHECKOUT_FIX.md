# Guest Checkout Fix - Loading Screen Issue

## ✅ Issue Fixed

Guests can now proceed to checkout without being stuck on a loading screen. The system now allows both guest and authenticated customers to place orders.

---

## 🔍 The Problem:

When a guest customer tried to proceed from cart to checkout, they encountered:

1. **Infinite loading screen** - Page never loaded
2. **Required authentication** - CheckoutPage forced login
3. **Poor UX** - No clear indication of what was happening

---

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed:

### 1. **Removed Authentication Requirement from CheckoutPage**

**Before:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading && !isCustomerAuthenticated) {
    setShowCustomerLogin(true); // Forced login
    return;
  }
  // Only loaded if authenticated
}, [isCustomerAuthenticated, authLoading]);
```

**After:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Load cart and table info (no authentication required)
  const savedCart = localStorage.getItem(`cart_${restaurantId}`);
  const savedTable = sessionStorage.getItem("tableNumber");

  if (!savedCart || !savedTable) {
    navigate("/t/${qrSlug}");
    return;
  }

  setCart(JSON.parse(savedCart));
  setTableNumber(savedTable);
  fetchRestaurantInfo();
}, [restaurantId, navigate]);
```

### 2. **Removed Login Modal from CheckoutPage**

- Deleted CustomerLoginModal component
- Removed unused imports and state
- Simplified the checkout flow

### 3. **Fixed Additional Dead Endpoints**

- CheckoutPage: Fixed navigation fallback
- BillSummaryPage: Fixed navigation fallback

## 💡 Why Guests Don't Need to Login:

### Backend Support:

The order placement API already supports guest orders:

```javascript
// From BillSummaryPage.jsx
customerInfo: customerSession.isAuthenticated && customerSession.user
  ? {
      userId: customerSession.user._id,
      email: customerSession.user.email,
      name: customerSession.user.name,
      phone: customerSession.user.phone,
    }
  : null,  // Guest order - no customer info
```

### Guest Order Handling:

```javascript
// From orders.js backend
if (customerInfo) {
  orderData.customerId = customerInfo.userId;
  orderData.customerEmail = customerInfo.email;
} else {
  // Guest order
  const guestEmail = `guest-${restaurantId}-${tableNumber}@temp.com`;
  orderData.customerEmail = guestEmail;
}
```
